# MidnightGit

A rich console-based git client.
Think [Midnight Commander](https://midnight-commander.org/) meets [GitExt](https://github.com/gitextensions/gitextensions).

## Why?

Devs are split in two rough categories: hard-core console users who do everything from the command-line and who are
missing out on nice merge graphs and other gui-friendly tasks, and mouse users who are forced to switch to the console
for advanced commands.
Both groups would get an improved experience from a unified client that seamlessly transitions between those two modes.

[Midnight Commander](https://midnight-commander.org/) is a great example of an application that mixes a rich, but
text-based experience, with the unrestricted power of the command-line.

Similarly, MidnightGit will show a rich view of your repositories, with fast access to the most common tasks, and
unrestricted access to the command-line at all times.

Also, having a client that easily works over an SSH session would rock.

Of course, it will be cross-platform and low-friction to install.

## How far are you?

I literally thought about this this morning (2/27/2018), so not very far at all, just getting excited with the idea and
thinking out scenarios and features.

## How did nobody think of this before?

I'm sure somebody did. Googling it found [this](https://jonas.github.io/tig/), for instance.

## How can I help?

Let's just brainstorm [there](https://github.com/bleroy/midnightgit/wiki) for now.
